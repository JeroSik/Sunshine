# Sunshine
A user-driven Alexa skill and web applicaiton that suggests clothing preference based off of weather and user's response to different weather conditions. During BoilerMake VI 2018 Purdue, a 36-hour hackathon which welcomes all levels of experience and provides tools and resources, our team decided to focus on creating a convenient way to analyize the weather.
